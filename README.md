# FDF

Welcome to FDF

In this project I discovered the basics of graphics programming, and in particular how to place
points in space to give a 3D effect using isometric projections. To connect the dots, I learnt about
two line drawing algorithms namely Bresenhem's line drawing algorithm and the DDA line drawing algorithim.
I chose to implement the DDA algorithms to connect the dots. The result is the following.

How to run FDF.

1) Go to the following link and install minilbx (This is a graphics library that students in France created for the school).
   -https://github.com/abouvier/minilibx.git
2) After installation, open your terminal and cd into the "fdf" root directory.
3) Now to compile the code, enter in "make / make re" into your terminal.
4) After the code has compiled enter in "./fdf test_maps/XXX" the XXX is variable name
   for any file that is in the test_maps folder.
5) That should be it. Thank you.
